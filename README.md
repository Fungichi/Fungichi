# Whoami

I am a hobbyist dev who doesn't know which IT field to pick.  
So I decided to be a noob in every field. (Well... not *every* field.)

I made 3 main categories:
 - No Jack of All Trades, but also a Master of None
 - My own ...
 - TheRetroWayâ„¢

## No Jack of All Trades, but a Master of None

### Web Development

- [A weird insect restaurant](https://github.com/Fungichi/DBW-django)  
  This website was made using the Django framework. It contains a webpage for a fictional restaurant called **The Blue Worm**.

### Other Projects

- [Discord Bot](https://github.com/Fungichi/Discordbot)  
  A Discord bot that lets users give or take each other's *aura*.  
  You get 500 tokens per day, which limits aura transfers to a max of 500 daily.

- [Noyevon](https://github.com/Fungichi/Noyevon)  
  A script I wrote to stop my school from spying on my computer during classes (spyware used: Veyon).  
  Check its README for more details.
