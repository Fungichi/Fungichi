I am a hobbyist dev who doesn't know which IT field to pick.  
So I decided to be a noob in every field. (Well... not *every* field.)

I made 3 main categories:
 - [My own... ](My_own.md)
> Making my own version of something, like a search engine, game , operating system, ...
 - [TheRetroWay™ ](TheRetroWay.md)
> Coding things the old fashion way, writing software for an old system, ...
 - [TheLeftOvers™ ](TheLeftOvers.md) 
> The projects that do not belong in the previous categories
