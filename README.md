# Whoami

I am a hobbyist dev who doesn't know which IT field to pick.  
So I decided to be a noob in every field. (Well... not *every* field.)

I made 3 main categories:
 - My own ...  
> Making my own version of something, like a search engine, music player, operating system, ...
 - [](#Project_categories/TheRetroWay™.md)TheRetroWay™  
> Coding things the old fashion way, writing software for an old system, ...
 - TheLeftOvers™  
> The projects that do not belong in the previous categories
