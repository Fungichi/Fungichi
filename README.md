#Whoami
I am a hobbyist dev that doesn't know what field in IT to pick.
Therefore i decided to be a noob in every field. (Not really every field)

##No Jack of all trades, but a master of none
### Webdevelopment
- `[A weird insect restaurant](https://github.com/Fungichi/DBW-django)`
This website was made using the django framework, it contains a webpage for a fictive restaurant called `The Blue Worm`.
### Other
- `[Discord bot](https://github.com/Fungichi/Discordbot)`
  With this discord bot you can give or take someones 'aura'.You have 500 tokens a day which means that you can give or take a max of 500 aura per day.
- `[Noyevon](https://github.com/Fungichi/Noyevon)`
  I made this script to stop my school from spying my computer during classes (Spyware: Veyon). You can check its readme for more details.
